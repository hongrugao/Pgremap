# Pg-remap reconstruction approach
We implement our novel Pg-remap reconstruction approach to improve the reconstruction process of PMA-based dynamic graph processing. We deploy the proposed approach on three existing work: (1) PPCSR (https://github.com/domargan/parallel-packed-csr), (2) Terrace (https://github.com/PASSIONLab/terrace), (3) VCSR (https://github.com/DIR-LAB/VCSR). The corresponding paper "Accelerated Reconstruction of Dynamic Graph Processing with Page Remapping" has been submitted to SIGMOD2025.
